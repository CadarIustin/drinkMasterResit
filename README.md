## Introduction

Welcome to Project Drinkmaster, an innovative and entertaining bartender robot designed to automatically dispense a variety of mixed non-alcoholic drinks. By using an Android application, customers can easily submit their orders, and the robot will accurately prepare the drink by moving the glass on a platform and stopping under each bottle included in the recipe to dispense the appropriate amount of liquid. This unique creation is perfect for bars, private events, and even home appliances.
